                    manifesto
                    outlining my core ethical and moral axioms of technological inclusion and ethically-aligned
                    design,</span>
                to guide my own
                design/technology practice.
                What started as a collection of my hopes and challenges for the
                techno-future, turned into a call to action; <span id="highlight">encouraging the active
                    investigation
                    of

                    technological
                    systems and an active contemplation of one’s own desired techno-future.</span> I then
                physically
                manifested
                this writing into a black box-puzzle.
