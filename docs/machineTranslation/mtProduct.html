    <h2> Hypothesizing the Future of Machine Translation</h2>

    <img src="cameleonlogo .png" class="image1">
    <p id="introP">
        To investigate and consider the potential of machine translation as an emerging technology, I completed a
        series of
        case studies <span id="highlight">to research, map, and speculate machine translation as it exists now and how
            this
            technology might
            evolve.</span>
        I began by making a system map considering the present and future entanglement of machine translation. I then
        made a
        speculative product, a machine translation software for AR called Chameleon, that allowed me situate and
        consider near
        future applications of what machine translation could look like and how this may effect and be incorporated
        into
        society. Lastly, I created a virtual museum exhibition that marked the evolution of this product and its
        trajectory
        into a destructive technology. Through these making-based research studies, I was able to <span id="highlight">forecast
            the
            potential
            manifestations and impacts of machines translat6ion in the near and distant future</span>.

        I created a speculative machine translation app that imagines the ability to pick up a Japanese book and seeing
        the text in English in real time, or
        walking around a foreign city and being able to read every sign, piece of information, and menu in your
        native
        language <span id="highlight">without taking out your phone, opening a translating app, plugging in the
            languages to
            translate
            between,
            taking a scan, and reading in the sub-par result.</span>

        Chameleon offers you the ability to do this via AR image processing in combination with deep learning neural
        network
        based machine translation. <span id="highlight"> Chameleon scans, detects, and coverts text to the users native
            language in real time</span>
        without
        any necessary input from the user other than their eye position relative to their environment. Chameleon can
        transform
        text to appear in to the language you speak <span id="highlight">bringing to life everything from books to
            entire
            cityscapes that
            you
            previously would not be able to comprehend or read as a native speaker</span>.

    <!-- <h3> How it Works</h3> -->
    <img src="storyboard2 copy-100.jpg" class="image1">

    <!-- <p id="narrativeP">
            David just moved to Japan from Canada and does not speak Japanese. He started using Chameleon with his AR
            equipped
            glasses when he first started feeling overwhelmed and lost in the city. He realized that in dated means of
            translation,
            such as Google Translate, is not only ineffective and cumbersome but is impractical for most everyday
            situations where
            he needs information quickly. Specifically, <span id="highlight">when he is driving, using public transit,
                or wants to
                read for
                entertainment. </span>David needed a solution that didn’t require him to take out his phone, open a
            translating
            app,
            plug in
            the languages to translate between, take a scan of the text, and read back the result from his phone
            screen. <span id="highlight">
                He
                often
                found himself enraged at the sub-par translated results that made little to no sense and felt
                constantly
                out of
                the
                loop.</span> Because of its UI simplicity, requiring only launching the application in his AR galsses,
            David does not
            have to be
            distracted
            or pause to scans text.
              </p>
        <p id="narrativeP">
            Instead Chameleon does all of the work,

            <span id="highlight">Using SLAM to detect and determine text in a foreign
                language in
                his
                line of sight,</span> Chameleon target pixels where foreign text is detected and projects an image on
            top
            that covers these pixels with the
            background it
            appears on.
            Simultaneously, <span id="highlight">Chameleon ueses its deep-learning neural network machine translation
                to
                convert this text
                into David's own
                spoken language and superimpose the translated text on-top of foreign text, giving David the
                experience of
                reading in his own language.</span>


            By making a multifaceted and highly complex translation job look
            and
            feel as easy as reading from sight, Chameleon has allowed David to safely drive in and navigate a
            new
            city while
            gaining greater insight to his environment allowing him to read sings, posters, and any piece of
            written
            information he encounters.

        For my final study, I built a virtual museam exhibition in unity to speculate the destructuve potential of
        machine learning. The museam follows the history and rise
        of Chameleon Technologies and the technological advancements
        that enabled
        its birth. This virtual exhibition examines potential partnerships and societal climate that could enable
        Chameleon software
        to become a biologically and culturally integrated platform. Building this exhibition allowed me to consider
        the trajectory of technological advancments in machine transltion and its entanglements and relationship to
        other emerging technologies.
        This exhibition has been
        curated
        with the
        intention to analyze the events and technologies that could led to a tumultuous rise of machine translation
        as
        a tool for
        manipulation.
