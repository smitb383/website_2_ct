    <h1> Chameleon </h1>
    <h2>The Future of Machine Translation</h2>

    <img src="cameleonlogo .png" class="image1">
    <p id="introP">
        Imagine picking up a Japanese book and seeing the text in English in real time, or
        walking around a foreign city and being able to read every sign, piece of information, and menu in your
        native
        language <span id="highlight">without taking out your phone, opening a translating app, plugging in the
            languages to
            translate
            between,
            taking a scan, and reading in the sub-par result.</span>

        Chameleon offers you the ability to do this via AR image processing in combination with deep learning neural
        network
        based machine translation. <span id="highlight"> Chameleon scans, detects, and coverts text to the users native
            language in real time</span>
        without
        any necessary input from the user other than their eye position relative to their environment. Chameleon can
        transform
        text to appear in to the language you speak <span id="highlight">bringing to life everything from books to
            entire
            cityscapes that
            you
            previously would not be able to comprehend or read as a native speaker</span>.

    <div class="narrative">
        <p id="narrativeP">
            David just moved to Japan from Canada and does not speak Japanese. He started using Chameleon with his AR
            equipped
            glasses when he first started feeling overwhelmed and lost in the city. He realized that in dated means of
            translation,
            such as Google Translate, is not only ineffective and cumbersome but is impractical for most everyday
            situations where
            he needs information quickly. Specifically, <span id="highlight">when he is driving, using public transit,
                or wants to
                read for
                entertainment. </span>David needed a solution that didn’t require him to take out his phone, open a
            translating
            app,
            plug in
            the languages to translate between, take a scan of the text, and read back the result from his phone
            screen. <span id="highlight">
                He
                often
                found himself enraged at the sub-par translated results that made little to no sense and felt
                constantly
                out of
                the
                loop.</span> Because of its UI simplicity, requiring only launching the application in his AR galsses,
            David does not
            have to be
            distracted
            or pause to scans text.
              </p>
        <p id="narrativeP">
            Instead Chameleon does all of the work,

            <span id="highlight">Using SLAM to detect and determine text in a foreign
                language in
                his
                line of sight,</span> Chameleon target pixels where foreign text is detected and projects an image on
            top
            that covers these pixels with the
            background it
            appears on.
            Simultaneously, <span id="highlight">Chameleon ueses its deep-learning neural network machine translation
                to
                convert this text
                into David's own
                spoken language and superimpose the translated text on-top of foreign text, giving David the
                experience of
                reading in his own language.</span>


            By making a multifaceted and highly complex translation job look
            and
            feel as easy as reading from sight, Chameleon has allowed David to safely drive in and navigate a
            new
            city while
            gaining greater insight to his environment allowing him to read sings, posters, and any piece of
            written
            information he encounters.

    <!-- <h3> How it Works</h3>
    <p>
        Using high level deep-learning image processing and SLAM to detect and determine text in a foreign
        language in
        your
        visible line of sight. Chameleon will then target the pixels where the text is detected and (using the
        AR
        projection)
        "erase" and rewrite that text in your native language.
        It does this by projecting an image on top of foreign detected texts that samples the colors of the
        background
        on which
        that text appears and covers these pixels where a foreign language text was detected with the
        background it
        appears on.
        It will at the same time use the high level neural network machine translation to convert this text
        into the
        users own
        spoken language and superimpose the translated text on-top of foreign text, giving the user the
        experience of
        understanding the language whether that be as a driver, pedestrian, or reader.
