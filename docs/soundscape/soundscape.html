            Soundscape is an <span id="highlight">interactive game that maps songs to signifigant geographic locations
                in
                New York
                via Augmented
                Reality and music</span>.
            The game
            will involve multiple users interacting in the same space, at the same time, and can always join into the
            same
            augmented world. The users will be looking for “musical checkpoints” that they are directed to by an AR
            visual
            through
            their mobile devices. The user is led to the target and then given other information about the song.
            While
            the game has no beginning or end, its larger purpose is to <span id="highlight">promote connectivity to the
                physical
                world through
                technology </span>, employing
            easily
            accessible and open source augmented reality applications as a tool to connect people
            to
            <span id="highlight"> author tangible and geographic social connectivity.</span>

        Soundscape brings the participant into the real world urban environment and functions at specific sites that
        will
        appear in the augmented reality of the game. The augmented scope will be based on geographic location.
        Users can activate these objects to access the music that is infused with them. We aim to root music in
        hisorical location to provide a type of
        emotional
        connection to space and the unveiling often overlooked or undiscovered histories of the place in the city that
        it appears in.
        The music
        that appears in each specific spot will correlate with a moment in history, history of an artist, or a
        cinematic moment in history
        from that
        space. <span id="highlight">The database of music and historical location would be an open source library that
            we would
            invite participants to add to to create a encompassing and inclusive soundscape of New York.</span>
