        After discovering I would not be able to talk to my sister, whom I am very close to, for several months, <span
            id="highlight">I
            created a data driven template that would allow me to thnk about and feel connected to her while she was
            gone.</span>
        Forever daunted by the periless task of catching friends and family up on months of my life, I created this
        template to make a organized journal account of my life and the outside world while my sister is away. Without
        the necessity of signifigant life events to occur in during her absence, in this way I can <span id="highlight">provide
            my sister
            with a realistic account of what my life was like while she was gone;</span> using the lanuguage and causal
        sisterly
        format we normally communicate with. Pulling from a google sheet using JSON, <span id="highlight">this page
            dynamically
            updates when
            I write to the google sheet, to make it easy and code-free in the everyday </span>to keep up journaling
        constancy.
        Additionally this meditative practice will enable me to talk to my sister everyday and feel close to her while
        she is gone.
