            I did a series of sketches to expand my processing vernacular and challenge myself to

            engage with

            normally actively ignore to prevent being upset. <span id="highlight">I created a code project using a new

            practice and
            set of fixed constraints<span id="highlight"> enabled me to gain fluency not only in the processing

                    Playing with the subject of conspiracy theories and "doctored information" within my daily article,
                    I
                    used the processing image
                    library to create a program that displays an image of the moon-landing and allows the user to
                    adjust and warp a conspiracy theory image . I related the preposterousness of Trump's conspiracy
                    theory claim to that of the
                    moon-landing conspiracy.

                    processing
                    recorded video library to create a program that plays a video of Aretha Franklin's performing
                    Respect in 1967. I experimented with user interaction and video so that when the user holds
                    down
                    and drags the mouse horizontally, the video will fast forward or rewind relative to the mouse

                <p>Thinking about a witch-hunt and the nouveau McCarthyism Trump is inspiring, I
                    created a program using the video capture and hyperlink libraries in processing that presents a

                    simultaneously turns on the users computer camera and starts recording them while they are reading
                    the article. The aim was to explore creating censorship in code and emulate the realm a modern day
