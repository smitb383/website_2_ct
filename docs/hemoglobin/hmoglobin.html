            <p>
                Planet Hemoglobin is coming out of a 500 year long ice-age due to intense factory production using
                nuclear energy and
                greenhouse gases which are melting the ice, as well as pumping enormous amounts of toxins and chemicals
                into the
                atmosphere creating a whole new series of never before seen cataclysmic events and “natural” disasters.

                This would prove to be a very big problem, as the beings of this planet have already gotten acclimated
                to cold weather.

                To make matters worse, the beings on this planet have no sense of touch or sensitivity to physical
                stimuli other than
                vision and hearing. This makes anticipating and understanding the effects of new environmental
                disasters nearly
                impossible.

                The climate / weather of this planet is variable but the mood is ominous and the air is filled with
                fear of the
                unknown. The skies are a mix of dark and toxin filled clouds and hues. The environment is full of thick
                dense fog and
                the melting toxin-filled ice glaciers add to the eeriness of the planet.

                To protect against these elements now and in the past (with the ice age) the species on this planet
                (who are
                essentially only skeletons) cover themselves in pumpkins as an adoptive exoskeleton, similar to how
                hermit crabs use
                shells as protection.

                The society is a dystopian pig farming society in which pigs are the only commodity, wealth, and food
                supply. Our characters survive solely on
                extracting and ingesting the
                blood of the pig. The purest blood is
                the red blood
                cells in the heart of the pigs() a mere 3-4 drops per pig). Purness of blood dictste value: Whole blood
                is
                the least valuable (cluttered with
                unnecessary platelets, plasma etc), next is blood without plasma, then blood without platelets,
                then blood that
                is just red and white blood cells, and then blood that is just red blood cells.

                The story follows a slavedriver dictator who desires nothing more than the purest pig blood at the
                expense of her
                people.

                She has a massive factory that farms these rare blood cells. She needs to farm roughly 1000
                pigs every days
                just for her personal use. The deconstruction of the atmosphere comes not only from the
                industrialization
                pig-blood
                extraction and
                shipping, but also the toxicity of the pig bodies themselves which are irresponsibly thrown into local
                bodies of water;
                creating magmic lakes of toxic energy.
