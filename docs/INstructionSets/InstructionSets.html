        XYZ is a series of graphically striking black and white painted cardboard tetris boxes that were
        grouped in
        Tompkins Square Park
        <span id="highlight"> to redirect pedestrian traffic as it flows through the park.</span>
        The project plays off the redesign of Tompkins Square in the 1930â€™s which intended to separate large
        mass
        gatherings and prevent political mobilization.
        In XYZ, park goers moved the boxes around, created arches, and gathered for play, or alternately felt
        apprehensive
        and distracted. In addition, the clusters of boxes <span id="highlight">visually lured or deterred park-goers,
            creating new
            paths,
            connections, and flows in the park.</span>

    <h3> Location</h3>
    <section class="body">
        <div class="text">

            <p> From salt marsh to rioting hub, from needle park to gentrified playground, Tompkins Square Park has a
                robust and
                highly <span id="highlight">diverse history that is synonymous and reflective of New York social
                    issues.</span>
                In our initial visits to the park, we found that the <span id="highlight">flow of pedestrian traffic
                    to be
                    dictated by a specific end destination rather than by free movement or exploration of the park.</span>
                Looking
                into the
                history of the park, we discovered this flow was intentionally built when it was redesigned by Robert
                Moses In
                1936, following the many labor riots, to divide and manage large crowds from gathering.

    <h3> Iteration 1</h3>
    <section class="body">
        <div class="text">
            <p> Our first iteration explored how <span id="highlight">redirecting traffic could unite and encourage
                    interaction
                    rather than
                    division </span>by
                playing off the redesign of Tompkins Square Park. We partially dammed one bottleneck walkway by placing
                a series of
                passageway
                at will.
                white carboard boxes within it and observed users navigate through and change the
                boxes and
                This interaction <span id="highlight">asked the audience to slow down, change course, and interact with
                    the piece; in
                    doing
                    so
                    re-orient themselves and their role in the park.</span>

    <h3> Iteration 2</h3>
    <section class="body">
        <div class="text">

            <p> Following this initial interaction, we wondered how clusters of objects, rather than a damming
                structure, could
                <span id="highlight"> encourage longer and more meaningful changes to this flow.</span>
                Our second iteration applied a basic grid system and seemingly complimentary but randomized schema to
                explore <span id="highlight"> how
                    pattern recognition might inform interaction. We recreated the boxes to enable a more playful
                    interactive</span>
                experience rather than a single block-aid formation. By creating an experience that offered structure
                as well as
                choice to the user, our <span id="highlight">interactive experience fundamentally shifted how people
                    moved </span>through
                and
                engaged with
                Tompkins Square Park.
