        In order to <span id="highlight">explore the conceptual mechanics of addiction, I created a robot whose only
            goal or
            "desire" is to
            follow a
            being in front of it.</span> However, <span id="highlight">if the robot is physically touched by a person,
            it dies and
            stops all functions.</span>
        I
        wanted to translate the idea of endlessly pursuing or chasing something that you know brings you harm, such as
        addictive or abusive relationships.

            <p> In order to achieve sensor-controlled movement I began by connecting DC motors to leg hinges and motor
                boxes
                provided by the Tamiya Stag Beetle robot starter kit. I then connected these motors to my Arduino
                microprocessor
                and coded them to move using the Arduino as the controller.
                After this I connective a capacitive sensor to the
                robot so that
                if touched by a human, the motors stop, it stops looking for a direction to move, its animated LED's
                turn off, and
                it prints "DEAD" to the console forever.

            <p> After, I connected two ultrasonic sensors to a breadboard facing in opposite
                direction. I programmed them to read in their respective distances to objects within a 30 degree radius
                of their
                vision, compare their distances from objects, and determine to move left or right depending on which
                sensor was
                closest to an object in its field. I then programmed this calculation to drive which motor was moved so
                the machine
                can in effect follow a human interacting with it.

                <p> By giving the robot limited goals and laborious movements, it appears pathetic and weak, even cute.
                    I found myself
                    establishing a loving yet patronizing disposition towards the robot.
                    The walking, crawling motion of it's motors and hinge mechanisms led me to even anthropomorphize
                    it's ultrasonic
                    sensors, which now resemble four large eyes. Furthermore, I caught myself gendering my machine,
                    referring to it as
                    "she."
                    By creating a subservient robot I reflected on my own human disposition to naturally feel dominant
                    over seemingly
                    "cute" machines. In addition, by programming the death of my own robot, I contemplated the human
                    role in.
                    perpetuating this dominance through manufacturing life cycles and death mechanics.
