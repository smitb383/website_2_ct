        To gain a deeper
        understand of
        the ways in which machines breakdown and attribute meaning to human language, I embarked on a quest to
        <span id="highlight"> visualize neural
            networks and their relationship with natural language processing,</span> and quickly realized it is neither
        concrete nor
        tangible in the way I was imagining. 
        I made three visualizations to compile my findings on word embedding,
        neural
        network structures, and natural language processing. After further research I organized these system drawings
        within the black-box paradigm of machine
        learning.
        Each exists <span id="highlight">"underneath" the black box, and as you go further from the shell, the
            processes go deeper into the structure of the machine learning and NLP structures.</span>
        I printed each visualized system on transparent velum
        so
        that <span id="highlight"> while hierarchical, they all appear and operate actively in tandem </span>just as
        these systems
        do in
        the
        real world.

    <p id="end">In attempting the visualize these absract concepts, I struggled in understanding the relationship
        between these
        different elements and processes and how they
        operated
        as a system.
        After an email dialogue with two data science specialists at Microsoft about how these parts interconnect, I
        was
        told, "they aren’t trivial questions and the answers aren’t trivial either" and that "the context is super
        important…and nuanced". In <span id="highlight">relinquishing my original plan to visualize these processes in
            a
            linear way, I gained a deeper understanding of the complexity of these systems and their
            integration as well as a visual organization of my learning research </span>
