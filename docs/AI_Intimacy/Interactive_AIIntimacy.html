            <h1> Interactive Research</h1>
            <h2> What it Would Really Be Like to Date Yourself</h2>
            <p>
                To continue to explore the social implications of creating Artificial Intimacy, I wanted to deepen my
                understanding of the ways in which data may be used and manipulated to achieve personalized intimacy in
                the future.Through looking into open frameworks plug in data libraries, I became aware of how many
                free, opensource, fully developed plug ins there are for various aspects of machine learning, data
                collecting and sorting, and user interaction/interpretation. I began by looking into the open-source
                programs and algorithms that are available and public for dissecting personal data, manipulating
                personal data, and reacting in real time to human behavior to update data. In short, I wanted to see
                how possible and available it was to replicate the "DNA" or architecture of a person based on their own
                data footprint.
            </p>
            <p>

                Realizing the availability of these technologies, I reflected on a comment a friend had made to me
                regarding frustrating with online dating apps: "I wish I could just date myself". Would you? This
                brought me to back to one of my earlier questions: how will people actually handle personalized
                highly-developed intimate experiences based on their own data usage? In short how will people interact
                and react to their own digital cloned persona ?
            </p>
            <p>
                My proposed interaction project would create generative DNA sets based on the users data footprint.
                This program would gather data from social and private media usage, use genetic algorithms to organize
                and breed this data into a single DNA sequence, and use the Vokaturi emotion speech recognition library
                to update the DNA based on the users interaction and emotional response in conversation.

                The idea of the app is to give the user the experience of dating a cloned version of themselves. The
                aim is to confront the user with self reflection from another point of view and question the legitimacy
                and premise on which future artificial intimacy will be created. Would this be a satisfying appeal to
                narcissism or a terrifying realization?
            </p>

            <h2> Questions I Aim to Pose With This Interaction:</h2>
            <p>How will personal data be used to discern our wants, desires, insecurities, and motivations to generate
                and personalize our experience of intimacy.
            </p>
            <p>If intimacy of the future is catered to creating personalized and optimized experiences to what degree
                will this be a reflection of our own desires and narcissism ? What will it be like to interact with a
                data -driven entity modeled off yourself?
            </p>
            <p> How will this cause us to change our own opinions and views of ourselves?
            </p>
            <p>Would having someone who knows your whole history, your likes , dislikes and has opinions and
                preferences based on your own be a dream come true or a self-reflection you are unprepared for and
                unwilling to have?
            </p>
            <p>To what degree would people see this clone as a reflection of themselves?
            </p>
