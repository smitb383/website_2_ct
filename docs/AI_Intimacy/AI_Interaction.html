    <h2> What Would It Be Like to Date Yourself</h2>

        I began by looking into the open-source
        programs and algorithms that are available and public for dissecting personal data, manipulating
        personal data, and reacting in real time to human behavior to update data. I was curious to see
        how possible and available it is to <span id="highlight"> replicate the "DNA" or architecture of a person based
            on
            their own
            data footprint.</span>
        Realizing the availability of these technologies, I reflected on a comment a friend had made to me
        regarding frustrating with online dating apps: <span id="highlight">"I wish I could just date myself". Would
            you? .</span>This
        brought me to back to one of my earlier questions: <span id="highlight">how will people actually handle
            personalized
            highly-developed intimate experiences based on their own data usage?</span> In short how will people
        interact
        and react to their own digital cloned persona ?

    <h3>Generating Your Clone</h3>
    <p id="end">
        My proposed interaction project would create generative DNA sets based on the users data footprint.
        This program would gather data from social and private media usage, use genetic algorithms to organize
        and breed this data into a single DNA sequence, and use the Vokaturi emotion speech recognition library
        to update the DNA based on the users interaction and emotional response in conversation.

        The idea of the app is to <span id="highlight">give the user the experience of dating a cloned version of
            themselves.</span>
        The
        aim is to <span id="highlight">confront the user with self reflection </span> and question
        the
        legitimacy
        and premise on which future artificial intimacy will be created.<span id="highlight">Would this be a satisfying
            appeal
            to
            narcissism or a terrifying realization?</span>
