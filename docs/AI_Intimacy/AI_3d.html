        To continue to investigate AI and intimacy, I explored how machines
        collect sensory input in relationship to humans. Additionally I aimed to <span id="highlight">explore the
            relationship
            between
            aesthetics of sensory
            inputs
            and
            human responsiveness to humanoid objects.</span> I
        3D modeled and printed an ear and created a circuit that connects a sound sensor to an Arduino microprocessor
        in order
        <span id="highlight">to create
            an ear that "can hear".</span> In studying the internal processes of sound to computation in humans and
        computers, I realized
        that the processes are based on the input - output<span id="highlight">
            black-box
            paradigm that governs not only machine learning but also understanding of the human
            brain.</span> I therefore separated my external and internal ears with a partially open black
        box to show the separation in functional and aesthetic perception.

                Following my research in natural language processing, I started <span id="highlight">researching the
                    anatomy of the
                    human
                    ear both
                    aesthetically and as a tool for collecting and interpreting information</span> from the outside
                world.
                I started by exploring the aesthetics of the ear in Maya and quickly learned how complex of a shape it
                is despite how rudimentary ears are in everyday life. Additionally through
                attempting 4 different ear models, I realized there are countless approaches to
                design this shape
                and<span id="highlight">
                    countless challenges in achieving something that looks convincingly human.</span>

            <p>
                I began investigating human perception of humanoid objects and the uncanny valley, a theory
                about humanoid aesthetics developed by Masahiro Mori, that states
                states <span id="highlight">the closer that humanoid objects get to resembling a human, while the
                    observer is still
                    aware its non-human, elicits a increasingly strong feelings of uncanniness associated with
                    eeriness and uneasiness in observers</span>. I then began to look further into the process of
                collecting and
                transforming sound
                stimuli into
                electrical pulses in an ear verses a computer. I was amazed at how similar the two processes are and
                that sound is electrically received and converted to the "brains" of both systems in an extremely
                similar fashion.

    <h3>Sound Sensing</h3>

            <p>
                My goal was not to program the ear to process auditory information but
                represent this as something that is aesthetically human in part and can also receive and
                process sound in the same way as a traditional human ear. This research led me to consider <span id="highlight">how
                    the
                    internal
                    processing of stimuli v the external appearance of a humanoid sensory-organ would effect
                    humanoid believability.</span>
