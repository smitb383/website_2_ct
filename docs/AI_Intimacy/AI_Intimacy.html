    <h2>Ideas In Form</h2>

    <h3>2D Study</h3>
    <h2>Neural Networks + Natural Language Processing</h2>
    <img src="stacked_AI2D.jpg" class="image1">
    <p>
        To gain a deeper
        understand of
        the ways in which machines breakdown and attribute meaning to human language, I embarked on a quest to
        <span id="highlight"> visualize neural
            networks and their relationship with natural language processing,</span> and quickly realized it is neither
        concrete nor
        tangible in the way I was imagining. 
        I made three visualizations to compile my findings on word embedding,
        neural
        network structures, and natural language processing. After further research I organized these system drawings
        within the black-box paradigm of machine
        learning.
        Each exists <span id="highlight">"underneath" the black box, and as you go further from the shell, the
            processes go deeper into the structure of the machine learning and NLP structures.</span>
        I printed each visualized system on transparent velum
        so
        that <span id="highlight"> while hierarchical, they all appear and operate actively in tandem </span>just as
        these systems
        do in
        the
        real world.

    <p id="end">In attempting the visualize these absract concepts, I struggled in understanding the relationship
        between these
        different elements and processes and how they
        operated
        as a system.
        After an email dialogue with two data science specialists at Microsoft about how these parts interconnect,
        I
        was
        told, "they aren’t trivial questions and the answers aren’t trivial either" and that "the context is super
        important…and nuanced". In <span id="highlight">relinquishing my original plan to visualize these processes
            in
            a
            linear way, I gained a deeper understanding of the complexity of these systems and their
            integration as well as a visual organization of my learning research </span>

    <h3>3D Study</h3>
    <h2>Aesthetics and Anatomy of the Ear</h2>

    <p> To continue to investigate AI and intimacy, I explored how machines
        collect sensory input in relationship to humans. Additionally I aimed to <span id="highlight">explore the
            relationship
            between
            aesthetics of sensory
            inputs
            and
            human responsiveness to humanoid objects.</span> I
        3D modeled and printed an ear and created a circuit that connects a sound sensor to an Arduino microprocessor
        in order
        <span id="highlight">to create
            an ear that "can hear".</span> In studying the internal processes of sound to computation in humans and
        computers, I realized
        that the processes are based on the input - output<span id="highlight">
            black-box
            paradigm that governs not only machine learning but also understanding of the human
            brain.</span> I therefore separated my external and internal ears with a partially open black
        box to show the separation in functional and aesthetic perception.</p>
